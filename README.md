# NIDS-using-Boosting-and-SMOTE
With the increasing complexity of cyber threats, traditional rule-based intrusion detection methods often fail to catch new or sophisticated attacks. This project uses modern boosting algorithms such as:

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

AdaBoost

These models are trained and evaluated on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, one of the most comprehensive public datasets for network intrusion detection research.

## Tech Stack
-Python (Jupyter Notebooks)

-Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

-XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, AdaBoost

-Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

-Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## Features
-Handles class imbalance using SMOTE

-Trains multiple ensemble models for comparative evaluation

-Evaluates models on standard classification metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix
