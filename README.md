# NIDS-using-Boosting-and-SMOTE
With the increasing complexity of cyber threats, traditional rule-based intrusion detection methods often fail to catch new or sophisticated attacks. This project uses modern boosting algorithms such as:

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

AdaBoost

These models are trained and evaluated on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset, one of the most comprehensive public datasets for network intrusion detection research.
